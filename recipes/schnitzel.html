    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Schnitzel is a thin slice of meat, typically veal, pork, or chicken, that has been tenderized by pounding, then breaded and pan-fried until crispy. This popular dish is a staple in German-speaking countries and is known for its juicy interior and golden-brown, crunchy crust. A classic Wiener schnitzel is made with veal and traditionally served with a lemon wedge.</p>
